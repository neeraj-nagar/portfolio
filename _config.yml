 I am a Graduate Research Student at the [University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/), where I am pursuing my Master's degree in Computer Software Engineering. My passion for software engineering and innovation stems from my strong academic background in electronics engineering, which I obtained from the prestigious [Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) BHU](https://iitbhu.ac.in/) in 2020.

 Before joining University of Waterloo, I contributed significantly to [Samsung's](https://research.samsung.com/sri-n) research and development projects as a Software Engineer for nearly three years. I co-authored three research papers and filed four patents, all aiming to enhance the user experience and push the boundaries of technology. Some of the topics I worked on include optical image stabilization, photography rules, audio equalization, and macrophotography. I also earned multiple certifications in data structures, Python, and deep learning, to further develop my skills and knowledge. My journey is driven by a relentless commitment to innovation and a vision to create a future where technology knows no limits. I am always eager to learn new things, collaborate with others, and take on new challenges. I would love to connect with you and explore how my expertise and passion can add value to your team and your goals. Together, we can shape the future of technology.
